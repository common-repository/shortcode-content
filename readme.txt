A simple shortcode-based content editing panel with separate login for editors. Make managing your content a breeze!

=== Description ===

Shortcode content was created with the objective to facilitate easy content editing for people who are not familiar with the WordPress admin panel.

This plugin allows admins to create snippets of text and assign them to a shortcode. The shortcodes will be replaced with the appropriate content wherever they are used throughout their website. These can be managed through a simplified, clutter-free Shortcode Content panel which contains only a table with all currently existing shortcode-content pairs.

A separate role called “SC Author” is created when this plugin is installed. Users with this role are restricted with access to the Shortcode Content panel only. This eliminates the chances of accidental changes made by non-technical to the website.


=== Features ===

Single Panel to control all the shortcode text.
Separate login for “SC Content” role users with only access to editing panel.
Create, update and delete shortcodes with ease.
Works with any theme!
